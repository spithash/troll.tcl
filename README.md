Gets troll quotes and makes people suffer!                                                                  

## Version 2.5   (19.11.2021)                                                                                  
                                                                                                           
Changed url because the old one was dead and enabled tls.                                                   
tcl-tls is required to be installed on your server.                                                         

Version 2.1   (20.03.2012)                                                                                  
                                                                                                           
Added flood protection. More like, throttle control. Special thanks to username.                                                                                
Any official release of troll.tcl will be announced in http://forum.egghelp.org/viewtopic.php?t=17078       
Official troll.tcl updates will be in this repo                                                                                                                                                          
Version 2.0 is way different since there's no database in the file. It fetches the quotes by a website.   
Also, you can ".chanset #channel +troll" to enable it.                                                    
I added this just in case you don't want your trolls to be available globally.                            
                                                                                                          
(Keep it to "puthelp" cause I didn't add any flood protection yet,                                        
and it may cause your bot "Excess Flood" quit if it's in "putserv" or "putquick",                         
if someone floods the !troll trigger or if the troll quote is too long.)
